# wordpress-hardener

As the script will tell you, run it at the root of your WordPress install. You can choose to harden or loosen the permissions, basically this allows WordPress to update itself or install a plugin. If you have insights on better ways of handling this kind of stuff, let me know!

```
curl -L -o 'harden_wp.sh' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrn55/wordpress-hardener/master/harden_wp.sh && sudo bash harden_wp.sh
```
and as always... you could clone (and/or fork for improvements):
```
git clone https://github.com/nrm55/wordpress-hardener.git
```
